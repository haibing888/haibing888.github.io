# Topic
The website is dedicated to introducing language learners to 2 things: 1. concept of a language map 2. language mapping learning strategy.
# Problem
People often quit learning foreign languages. One of the main causes of people giving up on language learning is foreign language anxiety(FLA). There are few reasons that cause that anxiety:
1.Perfectionism. According to their research anxious learners share many similar manifestations with perfectionists and these similarities have the potential for making language learning unpleasant.
2.Language difficulty.All language learners come to the classroom with certain baggage of beliefs, knowledge, prejudice towards the language developed prior to learning. One of them is perceived language difficulty: meaning students who chose languages that are generally accepted to be difficult, ex. Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Hungarian, Swahili, feel more pressured by that belief. Simply put, the more difficult the target language is, the more anxious the learners are.
3.Study length. The other big myth that stops people from learning language - sometimes even starting is lack of time, or to be more precise is perceived estimation of amount of time it will take to learn a language.
4.Lack of understanding of how one's mother tongue works. People perceive mother tongues differently from foreign languages. We act like sponges absorbing our native language not necessarily understanding how or why it works the way it works. As Butzkamm (2003) explains it - “Using the mother tongue, we have learnt to think, learnt to communicate and acquired an intuitive understanding of grammar. The mother tongue opens the door, not only to its own grammar, but to all grammars, inasmuch as it awakens the potential for universal grammar that lies within all of us. This foreknowledge is the result of interactions between a first language and our fundamental linguistic endowment, and is the foundation on which we build our Selves.Sparks and Ganschow (1991) assert that those who have difficulties with native language systems are liable to experience the similar problems when they attempt to learn a foreign language and thus make them anxious.
5.Language learning is different from other types of learning.As it was mentioned earlier people do not learn their mother tongue from scratch in an educational setting. Kids that go to elementary school already can already communicate in target language, they improve their understanding of a language, learn grammatical structures that underlie what they already can use. That causes lack of understanding of how to learn a language.

# User Stories
##User 1:
Elena is 24, she likes foreign languages, but never really succeeded in learning one. She took English in school, and then German in university, tried learning Spanish on her own after, but never got much further than very basic level. She is a very sctructured person, she loves math. Language for her is chaotic. She doesn't understand where to start, or how pieces fit together. She now takes Hebrew in community college, but feels like the materials they use are out-of-date. She feels like she needs to research some language learning strategies not to be repeat what happened with other languages she learned before. She googles language learning strategies and finds Language map website, downloads Hebrew map template and starts filling it out with words she learns as tutorials shows. At some point she understands she likes it better than using notebooks like she did before. Finally she understands what blocks language is made of and makes sense of all those words and grammar she learned before due to the visual structure that she was lacking before.
## User 2:
Jim is 30. He is good with languages: he speaks English and Japanese fluently. He feels like he can learn any language on his own now since Japanese is a pretty hard one and he managed to learn it earlier. He chooses Russian. But very quickly loses himself in cases, grammar exceptions and all things he never had issues with before since they are not existen in the languages he speaks. He is confused and lost. He googles language learning strategies and finds Language map website, buys Russian map and refers to it every time he is unclear of how certain word or rule would play out in the context of an actual sentence.
